In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will need to submit the 40 character
 SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from 0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that contains 
 the version of the files you want to submit. You can do this in GitHub by doing the following

Going to your GitHub repository web page for this assignment
Click on the “?? commits” link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository. 
For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should say “10 commits”.
You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit is at
 the very top. If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then just click the
 “copy to clipboard” button on the right hand side that should appear when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. 
 Paste this SHA-1 hash into the course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want to use 
 the most recent commit, then go down and find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.
A valid submission will look something like (this is just an example!)
